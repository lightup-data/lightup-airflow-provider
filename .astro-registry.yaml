# This file is intended to be a file which specifically calls out modules to be published to the Astronomer
# Registry as well as top-level Provider metadata. The file should not be packaged and solely lives in the
# repo. The modules listed should pertain to latest, released version of the repo.

# Python package name.
package-name: lightup-airflow-provider
# The name of the provider to be displayed on the Registry.
display-name: Lightup
# URL for where user should find the documentation for the Provider. This could be a link to the README,
# an external docs site, etc.
docs_url: https://github.com/lightup-data/lightup-airflow-provider/blob/master/README.md

# The next sections should be organized by module type (e.g. operators, hooks, functions, decorators, etc.).
#
# Within each section, the ``module`` value should be the path.to.the.module.specifically.
# For example, if the import path for a function is `from sample_provider.hooks.sample_hook import SampleHook` then the
# value should be "sample_provider.hooks.sample.SampleHook".

operators:
  - module: lightup_airflow_provider.operators.lightup_trigger_operator.LightupTriggerOperator
